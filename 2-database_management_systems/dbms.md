- **Definition:** A DBMS is software that interacts with end-users, applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze data. The DBMS manages the data, the database engine, and the database schema, facilitating the organization and manipulation of data.
  
- **Functions of a DBMS:**
  - **Data Definition:** Defines the data types, structures, and constraints in a database.
  - **Data Manipulation:** Provides a way to insert, update, delete, and retrieve data.
  - **Data Security:** Manages access controls to protect data integrity and privacy.
  - **Data Backup and Recovery:** Ensures data is safely stored and can be recovered in case of a failure.

### 2.2 Types of DBMS

**Objective:** Differentiate between the various types of DBMS and understand their use cases.

**Content:**

- **Hierarchical DBMS:** Data is organized into a tree-like structure, where each record has a single parent and possibly many children. Example: IBM Information Management System (IMS).
  
- **Network DBMS:** Similar to the hierarchical model but allows multiple parent-child relationships, forming a graph structure. Example: Integrated Data Store (IDS).
  
- **Relational DBMS (RDBMS):** Data is organized in tables (relations) with rows and columns. SQL is the standard language used to interact with RDBMS. Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server.
  
- **Object-Oriented DBMS:** Data is stored in the form of objects, similar to object-oriented programming. Example: ObjectDB.
